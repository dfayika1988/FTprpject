The problem of those if any single those those has  an error like
there ins't a gif associated with that word is not avaliable in the 
api the whole thing doesn't do work. 

Indivial handle error individually this why I used a try and catch. 

I have a second example that use axious. This another way to do the test. This in done in index2.js.
